Drained of their expression
Explusion, genetic defect
A ritual among our consumers
Not what you thought it could be

Limits of your Liberty!

Just take a look in the mirror
Tell me, what do you see?
Is this what you expected?
Forget what you thought it could be

Limits of your Liberty!

When I see you passing me by
You're not the one that I used to know
Nothing is left, everything's gone
A mechanised tool of the throne

When I see you passing me by
It's hard for me to understand
How could you submit, capitulate
In constant fear of the feeding hand?
