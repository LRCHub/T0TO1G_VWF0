See the mountains
With my lady
As the eagle
In the golden sky towers over purple majesty

In the mountains
Lives a freedom
There's a river
You can hear it say,"from the delta flows the liberty"

As the twilight of evening is broken
Lacy, silvery, starlight unfoldin'
'Round and 'round in a wave of emotion
Rings of love circles back to the spoken
Nothing equals a sea of devotion
Who desire sets the wheels into motion

We all agree
We live to be free
They can't tell us
They can't tell us, how to be

We, we all agree
You individually
We the people
Share the power
Hold the key
