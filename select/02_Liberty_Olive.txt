There's a gentleness within
There's a kindness that she'll bring
Through her eyes of sadness lies
All her love for him
Imprisoned every day
A handsome price to pay

Even when she's done her time
She'll insist that life is just fine
Someday soon she'll make her move
Seize her chance to shine
It's all that she can do
To free herself from you

It's her liberty
(That she wants you to see)
It's her liberty
(That she wants you to free)

Where has all her lifeblood gone
Will you ever see
Even if she understood
Is it written that she should

Come and see him when she is gone
He's surprised but knows he is wrong
A simple case of do or die
And now she's cut and run
Your vision let you down
You almost let her drown

It's her liberty
(That she wants you to see)
It's her liberty
(That she wants you free)

Where has all her lifeblood gone
Will you ever see
Even if she understood
Is it written that she should

It's her liberty
(That she wants you to see)
It's her liberty
(That she wants you free)

It's her liberty
(That she wants you to see)
It's her liberty
(That she wants you free)
